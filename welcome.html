    My name is Kevin Piehl and I am an experimental innovation economics. With my research, I aim to combine research
    questions from innovation economics with the methods of experimental economics. I am interested in
    innovation-related topics like how to design incentives to foster innovation, or what determines how R&D projects
    are selected or how venture capitalists decide on their investments. By creating experimental setups that create
    causal insights, I thrive to enrich the existing innovation economics literature.

    Currently, I am a PhD student at the Leibniz University Hanover at the institute of innovation economics. During
    my doctoral program, I completed courses on experimental and innovation economics but also on further methodological
    topics like machine learning or theoretical reasoning. Before that, I have obtained my Bachelor's and Master's
    degree in business administration and economics at the Leibniz University Hanover.

    My fascination for innovation started at the end of my Bachelor's studies when I was inspired by a course on
    economic growth and development. Thus, I started to work as a student assistant at the insitute of macroeconomics
    to gain first insights into working academically. This was also the starting point to learn coding: first, I learned
    R but from that day onwards, I learned also how to use Stata, Python, and Matlab, just to name some.

    In my free time, I am a passionate judoka where I have just obtained my third black belt (3rd Dan). While still
    fighting occasionally at tournament, I quickly switched sides and started at the age of 14 as an assistant coach.
    Some years later, I had my own training groups at up to three clubs simultaneously. In addition, I started my career
    as a judo referee where I currently have a licence that allows me to judge fights at the 2nd German Bundesliga.
    Combining both, I am also currently the refereeing director in Hanover where I supervise other referees and help
    them to improve their decisions.
